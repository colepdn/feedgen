TODO implement .well-known
	it is currently hard-coded
TODO implement error handling
	the format is {"error":"UnsupportedAlgorithm","message":"Unsupported algorithm"}
TODO implement multiple feeds handling. we return the same feed for every endpoint
TODO implement the cron script
TODO fucking databases. 
	use kysely, that's what they use in the bsky feedgen
	https://www.kysely.dev/	
	in feed-generator see db/index.ts and db/schema.ts
	schemas for posts only include bare minimum for feed skeleton generation
	include date created perhaps (i think indexedAt covers that, actually) as well as if the post contains media, and the author's did
	then we can get all posts from the author after a certain timestamp and then just count the list to get their frequency.
	and for the media feed we can just return posts that have media!
	we should probably also include an item for if the media has been marked nsfw
